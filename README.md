# Path Finding Robot Project

### Introduction
The path following robot will traverse the shortest path in a given map and sets of coordinates. The map will be projected onto the ground with dark traces representing the path. The robot will operate and navigate autonomously through a light sensing circuit coupled with a line following system and a shortest path algorithm.
